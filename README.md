# sekiro-sheath-mode
this mod allows you to change the render status of your katana in sekiro in a ghetto way
press dpad down to toggle the flag
its developed just for fun and experiment
only through pure reversing of sekiro binary

uses minhook and libmem to sigscan and hook (I know I could have just used libmem, dont question it)
